# CUBOTino base version

This repo contains the files to build CUBOTino_base_version: a Small, Simple, 3D Printed, Inexpensive Rubik's Cube Solver Robot.<br /><br /><br />

This robot is very small, simple, fully 3D printed, that solves the Rubik's cube in less than 90 seconds (not fast, but again ... it's very simple and rather inexpensive).<br />
