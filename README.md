# How to make the robot:
All the needed info are collected in a pdf file in the /doc folder: [document here](doc/How_to_make_a_very_small_Rubik_cube_solver_robot_20220630.pdf).<br /><br />
Very high level notes:<br />
- 3D print without support.<br />
- Set the servo to their mid position.<br />
- Verify the servos have 180deg range.<br />
- For the rotating base (cube_holder) the servo must have at least 190deg rotation; If not check the instruction on how to proceed.<br /><br />

# Searching for something more?
In case you find this robot too simple, or you're interested to a self-enclosed version, the you can consider the CUBOTino Autonomous version:<br />
- It reuses most of the parts from this Base version !!!<br />
- Thanks to a camera and a SBC (Raspberry Pi) the robot if fully autonomous.<br />
- You can see it at: [https://youtu.be/udr6tryxA_Y](https://youtu.be/dEOLhvVMcUg).<br />
