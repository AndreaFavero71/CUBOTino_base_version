# How to make the robot:
All the needed info are collected in a pdf file in the /doc folder: [document here](doc/How_to_make_a_very_small_Rubik_cube_solver_robot_20220630.pdf).<br /><br />
Very high level notes:<br />
- 3D print without support.<br />
- Set the servo to their mid position.<br />
- Verify the servos have 180deg range.<br />
- For the rotating base (cube_holder) the servo must have at least 190deg rotation; If not check the instruction on how to proceed.<br /><br />
