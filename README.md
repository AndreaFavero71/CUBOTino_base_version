# CUBOTino base version

This repo contains the files to build CUBOTino_base_version: a Small, Simple, 3D Printed, Inexpensive Rubik's Cube Solver Robot.<br /><br />

This robot solves the Rubik's cube in less than 90 seconds: Not fast, but again ... it's rather simple and inexpensive.<br />

# How to make the robot:
All the needed info are collected in a pdf file in the /doc folder: [document here](doc/How_to_make_a_very_small_Rubik_cube_solver_robot_20230118.pdf).<br /><br />
Very high level notes:<br />
- 3D print without support.<br />
- Set the servo to their mid position.<br />
- Verify the servos have 180deg range.<br />
- For the rotating base (cube_holder) the servo must have at least 190deg rotation; If not check the instruction on how to proceed.<br />
- If you use macOS or Ubuntu, update RubikTwoPhase solver to latest version (v1.1.1, released on 16th Nov. 2022).<br /><br />


# How to present the cube to the webcam:

# Searching for something more?
In case you find this robot too simple, or you're interested to a self-enclosed version, then you can consider the CUBOTino Autonomous version:<br />
- It reuses most of the parts from this Base version !!!<br />
- Thanks to a camera and a SBC (Raspberry Pi) the robot if fully autonomous.<br />
- You can see it at: [https://youtu.be/udr6tryxA_Y](https://youtu.be/dEOLhvVMcUg).<br /><br />


# Please leave a feedback if you build it
I hope many of you will decide to build your own CUBOTino, and that you'll enjoy it as much much as I did. <br />
I hope you will also post an "I Made it", on the Instructables site of this project (link above); <br />
I can ensure you, seeing a new born CUBOTino makes me feel very well ðŸ™‚
